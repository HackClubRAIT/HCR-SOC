    About HackClub RAIT Summer of Code
    </h1>
    <p>
        The HackClub RAIT Summer Of Code is a two-month open-source programme run by the HackClub RAIT this summer. 
        Over the course of two months, participants contribute to a variety of projects under the close supervision of competent mentors. 
        Students learn to contribute to real-world projects from the comfort of their own homes as a result of this exposure. 
        HackClub RAIT Summer of Code anticipates enthusiastic involvement with the goal of flourishing in the exciting open source culture 
        so that we may continue our initiative with a positive impact.
